# Realtime-Distance-Estimation-Using-Inverse-Perspective-Mapping-for-Mobile-Robots
This package is a demonstration of using IPM(inverse Perspective Mapping) to estimate the real word distance of a planar object (in my case the ground floor) from mobile robot equipped with camera. We make use of planar homography to transform points from Image plane to the world plane using Homography matrix H that is estimated using a calibration pattern. Once Homography matrix H is calculated we can use it to calculate distance of any point on the ground floor just by pointing at it using a mouse.
